## Running the scripts

This was written and tested on Mac OS X Lion, so I can't guarantee this running
on any other systems.

To install all the gems, simply run `bundle install`.

## Available scripts

__Catmull-Rom Spline Plotter__ A simple GNUplot-based CR splines plotter. Comes
with a few samples packaged â€” just uncomment various plots. To run, execute
`ruby cr.rb`.
